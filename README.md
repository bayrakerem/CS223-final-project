# FULLY FUNCTIONAL VGA CONTORLLER IN SYSTEMVERILOG
The VGA controller project involves designing and implementing in SystemVerilog a fully functional graphics module for the Basys 3 FPGA board that drives a standard VGA monitor at 640×480 @ 60 Hz. It begins with clock management—using a DCM or PLL to generate the 25 MHz pixel clock—and proceeds to a finite‑state machine that produces the precise horizontal and vertical sync pulses, accounting for front porch, back porch, and active‐video intervals. Concurrent pixel and line counters track the current (x, y) position, address a block‐RAM frame buffer, and fetch 8‑ to 12‑bit RGB values for each pixel clock. Read/write arbitration logic allows external logic to update the frame buffer while the display is running. After thorough simulation of sync timing and pixel data integrity, the design is synthesized and loaded onto the Basys 3 board, where it is validated by displaying color test patterns on a lab VGA monitor.
